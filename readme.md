Bjorn's Dotfiles
=======================

Finally got around to emulating my coworker [Victor Quinn](https://github.com/victorquinn). As he said:

> My relevant dotfiles. Idea being that on any new system I can just pull these off of github and be up and running quickly. Public repo in case anyone is interested.
